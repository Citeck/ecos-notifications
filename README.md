# `ecos-notifications`

Welcome to the Citeck `ecos-notifications` repository! This repository contains the notification templates and
configurations for the Citeck ECOS platform. Citeck ECOS is a powerful and comprehensive enterprise content and
operations system designed to streamline and automate business processes within organizations.

## Get started

If you are new to ECOS platform and would like to run the software locally, we recommend you download the Dockerized
version from [Demo repository](https://github.com/Citeck/ecos-community-demo).

## Useful Links

- [Documentation](https://citeck-ecos.readthedocs.io/ru/latest/index.html) provides more in-depth information.

## Dependencies

To run this application the following applications from ECOS deployment are needed:

* zookeeper
* rabbitmq
* ecos-model
* ecos-registry

## Development

To start notification-app for development with connection to local smtp server (like mailhog, 1025 port), run app with profiles:

- dev
- dev_local

if run on macOS, add the profile:

- dev_local_macos

for run with real smtp server see example in [application-dev_smtp_gmail.yml](src/main/resources/config/application-dev_smtp_gmail.yml)

run:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

If your IDE supports starting Spring Boot applications directly, then you can easily run the class '
ru.citeck.ecos.notifications.NotificationsApp' without additional setup.

### Building for production

To build the application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean package jib:dockerBuild -Djib.docker.image.tag=custom 
```

To ensure everything worked, stop original ecos-notifications container and start ecos-notifications:custom instead of
it.

### Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw clean test
```

#### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker compose -f docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean test sonar:sonar
```
